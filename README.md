## Technical Achievements
1. (5 points) Style your page using CSS. Each style rule you apply will get you 1 point for a maximum of 5 points. Be sure to describe your style rules in your README. 
    1. I added a red to half purple gradient. I use same these colors and gradient on my [personal website](https://gamestream.stream/resume). I made a color wheel for them but did not know how to use it.
    2. I changed margins and forced the body to be full size to allow for the gradient
    3. I changed the font color to white
    4. I changed the font for my name, wpi, and the british museum to comic sans, serif, and kings respectively. Plus I changed the default font to roboto - not sure if that was required.
    5. I put the bouncing image behind the text using postion and z-indexes and the video behind that
    6. I added twemoji.js so I could make the class year look cool.
    7. I also made the color wheel the favicon

2. (5 points) Add a simple JavaScript animation to the page.
    - I made the color wheel bounce around on the page dvd style due to not knowing what else to do with it.
    - I also made the video play anytime the mouse is clicked on the page
    - The video cant be stopped :)

3. (5 points) Experiment with other *semantic* HTML tags (links, images, tables, header, footer, etc.). Each extra tag you use will get you 1 point for a maximum of 5 points. Be sure to describe the tags you use in your README.
    1. I added the image that bounces around using the \<img> tag. The image is the color wheel which I didn't know what to do with.
    2. I added a hyperlink to my website, the british museum website, and my visitor tracker using the \<a> tag
    3. I used a \<span> for the emoji numbers
    4. I used a \<table> to show classes I have taken and my programming experience
    5. I used a \<video> element to show a wonderful and wholesome video

## Design Achievements
1. (10 points) Create a color palette using [color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com). Use all the colors in the palette in your webpage by implementing the appropriate CSS. Add a small screenshot of the color wheel for your color palette to your repo.
    - I made a color wheel using the webite. I am not really sure how to make the color wheel "good" nor do I know how to use it. I just put the colors I already used: Red, Half Purple, and White. I then used it as the bouncing image and for the favicon.
2. (5 points) Use a font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) in your website.
    - I used kings from google fonts for the british museum
    - Added roboto for the default font - dont think this was required, did it anyway
    - used serif for wpi - not from google fonts, but it is the font wpi uses I think
    - used comic sans for my name - also not from google fonts
    - added twemoji for the class year - I think it could be argued that this is a font as well.

## Graphic Design Text
- I rotated the text by -30 degress
- I rotated the background image by 30 degress in gimp to make the image flat once rotated
- I made the background image vibrate by toggling background-position-y: center
- I made the background image only show up though the text with background-clip: text
- On mouse click, I made the background-clip turn off so the user could see the image
